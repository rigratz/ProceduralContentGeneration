# ProceduralContentGeneration
Experimentation with procedural content generation for use in 2D game development.

Coded in Monkey. Files in PCGGame with .monkey extensions are my code. Other folders contain code in other languages compiled down from original .monkey files.

The code, in its current state, is far from ideal. Lots of commented code and some pretty bad organization in general. I was learning a lot of different things while working on it so I was kind of playing it by ear during the whole process. Were I to take what I've learned from here and apply it somewhere else, I would have a much better idea of how to organize the code into a much more coherent project.
